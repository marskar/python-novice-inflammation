    "loops,\n",
    "conditionals,\n",
    "and functions.\n",
    "What they *haven't* done is show us how to tell\n",
    "whether a program is getting the right answer,\n",
    "and how to tell if it's *still* getting the right answer\n",
    "as we make changes to it.\n",

    "this piece of code halts as soon as the loop encounters a value that isn't positive:"
